# About üóÉÔ∏è

[Splatter Paint](https://splatterpaint.vercel.app/) is a website featuring a simple yet awesome coding solution to draw on a HTML Canvas, and it's made using the ```  Paper.js ```  Library.
It was made possible with the help of Hack Club's ``` Splatter-Paint ``` [Workshop](https://workshops.hackclub.com/splatter_paint/), customized in depth with different options like:

- Moving around the mouse to draw circles of different sizes and colors.
- Dragging the mouse to make a linear path.
- The ability of export the canvas as a ``` SVG ``` Image.
- Etc.
